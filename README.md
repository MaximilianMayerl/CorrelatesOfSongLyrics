# lfm2b-lyrics-analyses

Project holds code for analyzing lyrical evolution w.r.t. sentiment, topic, and complexity of lyrics. Data based on the LFM-2b dataset, lyrics crawled from genius.com

`feature_extraction` holds the code we used to extract features from the lyrics crawled from genius.com.
`lyrics_analyse_full_feature_importance.ipynb` and `STATS_5_Genres.Rmd` contain our analysis.

For the feature extraction, put `wiktionary_english.json` into `./data`.
